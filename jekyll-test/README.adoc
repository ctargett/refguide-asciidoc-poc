This directory is a sample project using http://www.jekyllrb.org/[Jekyll] as a static site generator for the Solr Ref Guide.

If you have Jekyll installed locally (see http://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/), you can launch the Jekyll server to see the existing content in this project.

. Change directory to the top-level `jekyll-test` directory.
. Issue command `jekyll serve`. This will start the Jekyll server in the foreground; if you close your terminal window the server will die.
. Then go to http://localhost:4000/ for the Solr Ref Guide content.

Jekyll sample content is still in use in this sample project, click on the "Index Replication" link in the upper navigation bar to see that content. Images are also broken.

Also, while Jekyll provides several options for modifying templates, these have not yet been customized.

<h1>Apache Solr Ref Guide Proof of Concept</h1>
<p>As part of the proposal to move the Ref Guide from Confluence, this site provides demos of a small section of the Solr Reference Guide converted to Asciidoc format and published with various options.</p>
<p>The source for these examples is available in the GitHub repo <a href="https://github.com/ctargett/refguide-asciidoc-poc">refguide-asciidoc-poc</a>. See the README in particular for information about the methodologies used to produce these examples.</p>
<p>Since August 2016, several changes have been made to improve the conversion of pages from Confluence. The changes include: fixing code snippets and admonishments (such as NOTE, WARNING, etc.), auto-generated sidebar navigation, auto-generated PDF "base" file, and other smaller changes.</p>
<ul>
   <li><strong><a href="jekyll-full/apache-solr-reference-guide.html">Demo replica of full Ref Guide</a></strong>: Uses Jekyll to generate HTML pages, including a comments section on each page, and sidebar navigation.</li>
   <li><strong><a href="pdf/SolrRefGuide-all-0.0-DRAFT.pdf">Sample PDF</a></strong>: Uses Asciidoctor tools to create a PDF. The PDF is created from the same set of pages used to generate the Jekyll HTML pages for direct comparison. Warning: it's currently 27Mb.</li>
   </ul>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: Each example above is a demonstration of capabilities, not a final product ready for publication. Further effort is required before it is ready to replace Confluence.</p>
<h2>Known Issues and ToDos</h2>
<p>There are several remaining issues to be resolved that you may notice in these pages. See also the README in the in the GitHub repo <a href="https://github.com/ctargett/refguide-asciidoc-poc">refguide-asciidoc-poc</a> for more details, and additional To Do items.</p>
<ul>
   <li>The PDF may still have some issues with heading levels and page breaks.</li>
   <li>Nested blocks of content in tables (like code blocks or NOTEs, etc.) break the rows.</li>
   <li> Nested ordered lists (like 1, 2, a, b, 3, 4) get converted as a bad quasi-ordered list (like 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4).</li>
   <li>Finalize stylings of HTML and PDF outputs.</li>
   <li>Sidebar nav is auto-generated, but only one level. A bit more work is needed to try deeper nesting.</li>
   <li>The PDF may need to be compressed. Check this and investigate solutions once full Guide has been converted.</li>
   <li>Fix broken "tag" pages in Jekyll site.</li>
</ul>

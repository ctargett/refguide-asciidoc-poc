<h1>Apache Solr Ref Guide Proof of Concept</h1>
<p>As part of the proposal to move the Ref Guide from Confluence, this site provides demos of a small section of the Solr Reference Guide converted to Asciidoc format and published with various options.</p>
<p>The source for these examples is available in the GitHub repo <a href="https://github.com/ctargett/refguide-asciidoc-poc">refguide-asciidoc-poc</a>. See the README in particular for information about the methodologies used to produce these examples.</p>
<ul>
   <li><a href="jekyll/index.html">Example using Jekyll</a>: Uses Jekyll to generate HTML pages, including a comments section on each page, and a sidebar navigation.</li>
   <li><a href="jbake/index.html">Example using JBake</a>: Uses JBake to generate HTML pages, including a comments section on each page. This is available for comparison with the Jekyll-generated pages, but I don't intend to take this example further than this.</li>
   <li><a href="pdf/SolrRefGuide-0.0-DRAFT.pdf">Sample PDF</a>: Uses Asciidoctor tools to create a PDF. The PDF is created from the same set of pages used to generate the Jekyll HTML pages for direct comparison.</li>
   </ul>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: Each example above is a demonstration of capabilities, not a final product ready for publication. Further effort is required before it is ready to replace Confluence.</p>
<h2>Known Issues and ToDos</h2>
<p>There are several remaining issues to be resolved that you may notice in these pages. See also the README in the in the GitHub repo <a href="https://github.com/ctargett/refguide-asciidoc-poc">refguide-asciidoc-poc</a> for more details, and additional To Do items.</p>
<ul>
   <li>Demonstrate the full Solr Ref Guide in HTML (using Jekyll) and PDF.</li>
   <li>Fix broken "tag" pages in Jekyll site.</li>
   <li>The PDF has some issues with heading levels and page breaks.</li>
   <li>Possibly auto-generate Jekyll sidebar and pages to be included in the PDF. Each of these today require maintaining separate data files, requiring extra coordination pre-publication.</li>
   <li>The PDF may need to be compressed. Check this and investigate solutions once full Guide has been converted.</li>
   <li>Finalize stylings of HTML and PDF outputs.</li>
</ul>

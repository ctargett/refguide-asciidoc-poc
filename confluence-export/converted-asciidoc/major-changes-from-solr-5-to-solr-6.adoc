Major Changes from Solr 5 to Solr 6
===================================

There are some major changes in Solr 6 to consider before starting to migrate your configurations and indexes. There are many hundreds of changes, so a thorough review of the <<upgrading-solr.adoc#,Upgrading Solr>> section as well as the <<major-changes-from-solr-5-to-solr-6.adoc#,CHANGES.txt>> file in your Solr instance will help you plan your migration to Solr 6. This section attempts to highlight some of the major changes you should be aware of.toc::[]

[[MajorChangesfromSolr5toSolr6-HighlightsofNewFeaturesinSolr6]]
== Highlights of New Features in Solr 6

Some of the major improvements in Solr 6 include:

[[MajorChangesfromSolr5toSolr6-StreamingExpressions]]
=== Streaming Expressions

Introduced in Solr 5, <<streaming-expressions.adoc#,Streaming Expressions>> allow querying Solr and getting results as a stream of data, sorted and aggregated as requested.

Several new expression types have been added in Solr 6:

* Parallel expressions using a MapReduce-like shuffling for faster throughput of high-cardinality fields.
* Daemon expressions to support continuous push or pull streaming.
* Advanced parallel relational algebra like distributed joins, intersections, unions and complements.
* Publish/Subscribe messaging.
* JDBC connections to pull data from other systems and join with documents in the Solr index.

[[MajorChangesfromSolr5toSolr6-ParallelSQLInterface]]
=== Parallel SQL Interface

Built on streaming expressions, new in Solr 6 is a <<parallel-sql-interface.adoc#,Parallel SQL interface>> to be able to send SQL queries to Solr. SQL statements are compiled to streaming expressions on the fly, providing the full range of aggregations available to streaming expression requests. A JDBC driver is included, which allows using SQL clients and database visualization tools to query your Solr index and import data to other systems.

[[MajorChangesfromSolr5toSolr6-CrossDataCenterReplication]]
=== Cross Data Center Replication

Replication across data centers is now possible with <<cross-data-center-replication-cdcr-.adoc#,Cross Data Center Replication>>. Using an active-passive model, a SolrCloud cluster can be replicated to another data center, and monitored with a new API.

[[MajorChangesfromSolr5toSolr6-GraphQueryParser]]
=== Graph Query Parser

A new <<other-parsers.adoc#OtherParsers-GraphQueryParser,`graph` query parser>> makes it possible to to graph traversal queries of Directed (Cyclic) Graphs modelled using Solr documents.

[[MajorChangesfromSolr5toSolr6-DocValues]]
=== DocValues

Most non-text field types in the Solr sample configsets now default to using <<docvalues.adoc#,DocValues>>.

[[MajorChangesfromSolr5toSolr6-Java8Required]]
== Java 8 Required

The minimum supported version of Java for Solr 6 (and the <<using-solrj.adoc#,SolrJ client libraries>>) is now Java 8.

[[MajorChangesfromSolr5toSolr6-IndexFormatChanges]]
== Index Format Changes

Solr 6 has no support for reading Lucene/Solr 4.x and earlier indexes. Be sure to run the Lucene `IndexUpgrader` included with Solr 5.5 if you might still have old 4x formatted segments in your index. Alternatively: fully optimize your index with Solr 5.5 to make sure it consists only of one up-to-date index segment.

[[MajorChangesfromSolr5toSolr6-ManagedSchemaisnowtheDefault]]
== Managed Schema is now the Default

Solr's default behavior when a `solrconfig.xml` does not explicitly define a `<schemaFactory/>` is now dependent on the `luceneMatchVersion` specified in that `solrconfig.xml`. When `luceneMatchVersion < 6.0`, `ClassicIndexSchemaFactory` will continue to be used for back compatibility, otherwise an instance of `ManagedIndexSchemaFactory` will be used.

The most notable impacts of this change are:

* Existing `solrconfig.xml` files that are modified to use `luceneMatchVersion >= 6.0`, but do _not_ have an explicitly configured `ClassicIndexSchemaFactory`, will have their `schema.xml` file automatically upgraded to a `managed-schema` file.
* Schema modifications via the <<schema-api.adoc#,Schema API>> will now be enabled by default.

Please review the <<schema-factory-definition-in-solrconfig.adoc#,Schema Factory Definition in SolrConfig>> section for more details.

[[MajorChangesfromSolr5toSolr6-DefaultSimilarityChanges]]
== Default Similarity Changes

Solr's default behavior when a Schema does not explicitly define a global `<similarity/>` is now dependent on the `luceneMatchVersion` specified in the `solrconfig.xml`. When `luceneMatchVersion < 6.0`, an instance of <<major-changes-from-solr-5-to-solr-6.adoc#,`ClassicSimilarityFactory`>> will be used, otherwise an instance of <<major-changes-from-solr-5-to-solr-6.adoc#,`SchemaSimlarityFactory`>> will be used. Most notably this change means that users can take advantage of per Field Type similarity declarations, with out needing to also explicitly declare a global usage of `SchemaSimlarityFactory`.

Regardless of whether it is explicitly declared, or used as an implicit global default, `SchemaSimlarityFactory`'s implicit behavior when a Field Types do not declare an explicit `<similarity />` has also been changed to depend on the the `luceneMatchVersion`. When `luceneMatchVersion < 6.0`, an instance of <<major-changes-from-solr-5-to-solr-6.adoc#,`ClassicSimilarity`>> will be used, otherwise an instance of <<major-changes-from-solr-5-to-solr-6.adoc#,`BM25Simlarity`>> will be used. A `defaultSimFromFieldType` init option may be specified on the `SchemaSimilarityFactory` declaration to change this behavior. Please review the <<major-changes-from-solr-5-to-solr-6.adoc#,`SchemaSimlarityFactory` javadocs>> for more details

[[MajorChangesfromSolr5toSolr6-Replica&ShardDeleteCommandChanges]]
== Replica & Shard Delete Command Changes

The <<collections-api.adoc#,DELETESHARD and DELETEREPLICA>> now default to deleting the instance directory, data directory, and index directory for any replica they delete. Please review the <<collections-api.adoc#,Collection API>> documentation for details on new request parameters to prevent this behavior if you wish to keep all data on disk when using these commands

[[MajorChangesfromSolr5toSolr6-facet.date.*ParametersRemoved]]
== `facet.date.*` Parameters Removed

The `facet.date` parameter (and associated `facet.date.*` parameters) that were deprecated in Solr 3.x have been removed completely. If you have not yet switched to using the equivalent `facet.range` functionality you must do so now before upgrading.

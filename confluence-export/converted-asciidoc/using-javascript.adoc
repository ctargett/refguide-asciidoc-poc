Using Solr from JavaScript clients is so straightforward that it deserves a special mention. In fact, it is so straightforward that there is no client API. You don't need to install any packages or configure anything.

HTTP requests can be sent to Solr using the standard `XMLHttpRequest` mechanism.

Out of the box, Solr can send <<response-writers.adoc#ResponseWriters-JSONResponseWriter,JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) responses>>, which are easily interpreted in JavaScript. Just add `wt=json` to the request URL to have responses sent as JSON.

For more information and an excellent example, read the SolJSON page on the Solr Wiki:

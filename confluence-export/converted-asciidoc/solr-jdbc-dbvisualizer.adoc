For https://www.dbvis.com/[DbVisualizer], you will need to create a new driver for Solr using the DbVisualizer Driver Manager. This will add several SolrJ client .jars to the DbVisualizer classpath. The files required are:

* all .jars found in `$SOLR_HOME/dist/solrj-lib`
* the SolrJ .jar found at `$SOLR_HOME/dist/solr-solrj-<version>.jar`

Once the driver has been created, you can create a connection to Solr with the connection string format outlined in the generic section and use the SQL Commander to issue queries.

The Driver Class will also be automatically added when the driver .jars are added.

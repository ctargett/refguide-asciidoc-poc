Installing Solr
---------------

This section describes how to install Solr. You can install Solr in any system where a suitable Java Runtime Environment (JRE) is available, as detailed below. Currently this includes Linux, OS X, and Microsoft Windows. The instructions in this section should work for any platform, with a few exceptions for Windows as noted.

[[InstallingSolr-GotJava?]]
Got Java?
~~~~~~~~~

You will need the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) version 1.7 or higher. At a command line, check your Java version like this:

---------------------------------------------------------------
$ java -version
java version "1.8.0_60"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_60-b27)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.60-b23, mixed mode)
---------------------------------------------------------------

The exact output will vary, but you need to make sure you meet the minimum version requirement. We also recommend choosing a version that is not end-of-life from its vendor. If you don't have the required version, or if the java command is not found, download and install the latest version from Oracle at http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html.

Installing Solr
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Solr is available from the Solr website at http://lucene.apache.org/solr/.

For Linux/Unix/OSX systems, download the `.tgz` file. For Microsoft Windows systems, download the `.zip` file. When getting started, all you need to do is extract the Solr distribution archive to a directory of your choosing. When you're ready to setup Solr for a production environment, please refer to the instructions provided on the link:Taking-Solr-to-Production.html[Taking Solr to Production] page. To keep things simple for now, extract the Solr distribution archive to your local home directory, for instance on Linux, do:

------------------------
$ cd ~/
$ tar zxf solr-5.0.0.tgz
------------------------

Once extracted, you are now ready to run Solr using the instructions provided in the link:Running-Solr.html[Running Solr] section.

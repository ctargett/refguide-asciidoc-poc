This section describes how Solr adds data to its index. It covers the following topics:

* **link:introduction-to-solr-indexing.html[Introduction to Solr Indexing]**: An overview of Solr's indexing process.

* **link:post-tool.html[Post Tool]**: Information about using `post.jar` to quickly upload some content to your system.

* **link:uploading-data-with-index-handlers.html[Uploading Data with Index Handlers]**: Information about using Solr's Index Handlers to upload XML/XSLT, JSON and CSV data.

* **link:uploading-data-with-solr-cell-using-apache-tika.html[Uploading Data with Solr Cell using Apache Tika]**: Information about using the Solr Cell framework to upload data for indexing.

* **link:uploading-structured-data-store-data-with-the-data-import-handler.html[Uploading Structured Data Store Data with the Data Import Handler]**: Information about uploading and indexing data from a structured data store.

* **link:updating-parts-of-documents.html[Updating Parts of Documents]**: Information about how to use atomic updates and optimistic concurrency with Solr.

* **link:detecting-languages-during-indexing.html[Detecting Languages During Indexing]**: Information about using language identification during the indexing process.

* **link:de-duplication.html[De-Duplication]**: Information about configuring Solr to mark duplicate documents as they are indexed.

* **link:content-streams.html[Content Streams]**: Information about streaming content to Solr Request Handlers.

* **link:uima-integration.html[UIMA Integration]**: Information about integrating Solr with Apache's Unstructured Information Management Architecture (UIMA). UIMA lets you define custom pipelines of Analysis Engines that incrementally add metadata to your documents as annotations.

=== Indexing Using Client APIs

Using client APIs, such as link:using-solrj.html[SolrJ], from your applications is an important option for updating Solr indexes. See the link:client-apis.html[Client APIs] section for more information.

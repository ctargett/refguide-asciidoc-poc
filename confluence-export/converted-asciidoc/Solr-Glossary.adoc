[[SolrGlossary-Atomicupdates]]
link:Updating-Parts-of-Documents.html#UpdatingPartsofDocuments-AtomicUpdates[Atomic updates]

[[SolrGlossary-Cluster]]
Cluster

In Solr, a cluster is a set of Solr nodes managed as a unit. They may contain many cores, collections, shards, and/or replicas. See also link:#SolrGlossary-SolrCloud[#SolrCloud].

[[SolrGlossary-Collection]]
Collection

In Solr, one or more documents grouped together in a single logical index. A collection must have a single schema, but can be spread across multiple cores.

In link:#SolrGlossary-ZooKeeper[#ZooKeeper], a group of cores managed together as part of a SolrCloud installation.

[[SolrGlossary-Commit]]
Commit

To make document changes permanent in the index. In the case of added documents, they would be searchable after a __commit__.

[[SolrGlossary-Core]]
Core

An individual Solr instance (represents a logical index). Multiple cores can run on a single node. See also link:#SolrGlossary-SolrCloud[#SolrCloud].

[[SolrGlossary-Corereload]]
Core reload

To re-initialize Solr after changes to `schema.xml`, `solrconfig.xml` or other configuration files.

[[SolrGlossary-D]]
D
~

[[SolrGlossary-Distributedsearch]]
Distributed search

Distributed search is one where queries are processed across more than one link:#SolrGlossary-Shard[shard].

[[SolrGlossary-Document]]
Document

A group of link:#SolrGlossary-Field[fields] and their values. Documents are the basic unit of data in a link:#SolrGlossary-Collection[collection]. Documents are assigned to link:#SolrGlossary-Shard[shards] using standard hashing, or by specifically assigning a shard within the document ID. Documents are versioned after each write operation.

[[SolrGlossary-E]]
E
~

[[SolrGlossary-Ensemble]]
Ensemble

A link:#SolrGlossary-ZooKeeper[#ZooKeeper] term to indicate multiple ZooKeeper instances running simultaneously.

[[SolrGlossary-F]]
F
~

[[SolrGlossary-Facet]]
Facet

The arrangement of search results into categories based on indexed terms.

[[SolrGlossary-Field]]
Field

The content to be indexed/searched along with metadata defining how the content should be processed by Solr.

[[SolrGlossary-I]]
I
~

[[SolrGlossary-Inversedocumentfrequency(IDF)]]
Inverse document frequency (IDF)

A measure of the general importance of a term. It is calculated as the number of total Documents divided by the number of Documents that a particular word occurs in the collection. See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf-idf and http://lucene.apache.org/core/5_3_0/core/org/apache/lucene/search/similarities/TFIDFSimilarity.html[theÂ Lucene TFIDFSimilarity javadocs] for more info on TF-IDF based scoring and Lucene scoring in particular. See also link:#SolrGlossary-Termfrequency[#Term frequency].

[[SolrGlossary-Invertedindex]]
Inverted index

A way of creating a searchable index that lists every word and the documents that contain those words, similar to an index in the back of a book which lists words and the pages on which they can be found. When performing keyword searches, this method is considered more efficient than the alternative, which would be to create a list of documents paired with every word used in each document. Since users search using terms they expect to be in documents, finding the term before the document saves processing resources and time.

[[SolrGlossary-L]]
L
~

[[SolrGlossary-Leader]]
Leader

The main node for each shard that routes document adds, updates, or deletes to other replicas in the same shard - this is a transient responsibility assigned to a node via an election, if the current Shard Leader goes down, a new node will be elected to take it's place. See also link:#SolrGlossary-SolrCloud[#SolrCloud].

[[SolrGlossary-M]]
M
~

[[SolrGlossary-Metadata]]
Metadata

Literally, __data about data__. Metadata is information about a document, such as it's title, author, or location.

[[SolrGlossary-N]]
N
~

[[SolrGlossary-Naturallanguagequery]]
Natural language query

A search that is entered as a user would normally speak or write, as in, "What is aspirin?"

[[SolrGlossary-Node]]
Node

A JVM instance running Solr. Also known as a Solr server.

[[SolrGlossary-O]]
O
~

[[SolrGlossary-Optimisticconcurrency]]
link:Updating-Parts-of-Documents.html#UpdatingPartsofDocuments-OptimisticConcurrency[Optimistic concurrency]

Also known as "optimistic locking", this is an approach that allows for updates to documents currently in the index while retaining locking or version control.

[[SolrGlossary-Overseer]]
Overseer

A single node in SolrCloud that is responsible for processing actions involving the entire cluster. It keeps track of the state of existing nodes and shards, and assigns shards to nodes - this is a transient responsibility assigned to a node via an election, if the current Overseer goes down, a new node will be elected to take it's place. See also link:#SolrGlossary-SolrCloud[#SolrCloud].

[[SolrGlossary-Q]]
Q
~

[[SolrGlossary-Queryparser]]
Query parser

A query parser processes the terms entered by a user.

[[SolrGlossary-R]]

[[SolrGlossary-Recall]]
Recall

The ability of a search engine to retrieve _all_ of the possible matches to a user's query.

[[SolrGlossary-Relevance]]
Relevance

The appropriateness of a document to the search conducted by the user.

[[SolrGlossary-Replica]]

[[SolrGlossary-SolrConfig(solrconfig.xml)]]

The ability to suggest alternative spellings of search terms to a user, as a check against spelling errors causing few or zero results.

[[SolrGlossary-Stopwords]]
Stopwords

Generally, words that have little meaning to a user's search but which may have been entered as part of a link:#SolrGlossary-Naturallanguagequery[natural language] query. Stopwords are generally very small pronouns, conjunctions and prepositions (such as, "the", "with", or "and")

Synonyms generally are terms which are near to each other in meaning and may substitute for one another. In a search engine implementation, synonyms may be abbreviations as well as words, or terms that are not consistently hyphenated. Examples of synonyms in this context would be "Inc." and "Incorporated" or "iPod" and "i-pod".

[[SolrGlossary-Termfrequency]]

The number of times a word occurs in a given document.

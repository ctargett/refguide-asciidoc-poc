Core Admin
----------

The Core Admin screen lets you manage your cores.

The buttons at the top of the screen let you add a new core, unload the core displayed, rename the currently displayed core, swap the existing core with one that you specify in a drop-down box, reload the current core, and optimize the current core.

The main display and available actions correspond to the commands used with the link:CoreAdmin-API.html[CoreAdminHandler], but provide another way of working with your cores.

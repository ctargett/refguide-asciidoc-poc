Cloud Screens
=============
:page-shortname: cloud-screens
:page-permalink: cloud-screens.html

When running in <<solrcloud.adoc#,SolrCloud>> mode, a "Cloud" option will appear in the Admin UI between <<logging.adoc#,Logging>> and <<collections-core-admin.adoc#,Collections/Core Admin>> which provides status information about each collection & node in your cluster, as well as access to the low level data being stored in <<using-zookeeper-to-manage-configuration-files.adoc#,Zookeeper>>.

Only Visible When using SolrCloud

Note:

The "Cloud" menu option is only available on Solr instances running in <<getting-started-with-solrcloud.adoc#,SolrCloud mode>>. Single node or master/slave replication instances of Solr will not display this option.

Click on the Cloud option in the left-hand navigation, and a small sub-menu appears with options called "Tree", "Graph", "Graph (Radial)" and "Dump". The default view ("Graph") shows a graph of each collection, the shards that make up those collections, and the addresses of each replica for each shard.

This example shows the very simple two-node cluster created using the "`bin/solr -e cloud -noprompt`" example command. In addition to the 2 shard, 2 replica "gettingstarted" collection, there is an additional "films" collection consisting of a single shard/replica:

The "Graph (Radial)" option provides a different visual view of each node. Using the same example cluster, the radial graph view looks like:

The "Tree" option shows a directory structure of the data in ZooKeeper, including cluster wide information regarding the `live_nodes` and `overseer` status, as well as collection specific information such as the `state.json`, current shard leaders, and configuration files in use. In this example, we see the `state.json` file definition for the "films" collection:

The final option is "Dump", which returns a JSON document containing all nodes, their contents and their children (recursively). This can be used to export a snapshot of all the data that Solr has kept inside ZooKeeper and can aid in debugging SolrCloud problems.

This section describes how Solr works with search requests. It covers the following topics:

* link:overview-of-searching-in-solr.html[Overview of Searching in Solr]: An introduction to searching with Solr.
* link:velocity-search-ui.html[Velocity Search UI]: A simple search UI using the VelocityResponseWriter.
* link:relevance.html[Relevance]: Conceptual information about understanding relevance in search results.
* link:query-syntax-and-parsing.html[Query Syntax and Parsing]: A brief conceptual overview of query syntax and parsing. It also contains the following sub-sections:
** link:common-query-parameters.html[Common Query Parameters]: No matter the query parser, there are several parameters that are common to all of them.
** link:the-standard-query-parser.html[The Standard Query Parser]: Detailed information about the standard Lucene query parser.
** link:the-dismax-query-parser.html[The DisMax Query Parser]: Detailed information about Solr's DisMax query parser.

* link:highlighting.html[Highlighting]: Detailed information about Solr's highlighting utilities. Sub-sections cover the different types of highlighters:
** link:standard-highlighter.html[Standard Highlighter]: Uses the most sophisticated and fine-grained query representation of the three highlighters.
** link:fastvector-highlighter.html[FastVector Highlighter]: Optimized for term vector options on fields, and good for large documents and multiple languages.
** link:postings-highlighter.html[Postings Highlighter]: Uses similar options as the FastVector highlighter, but is more compact and efficient.
* link:spell-checking.html[Spell Checking]: Detailed information about Solr's spelling checker.
* link:query-re-ranking.html[Query Re-Ranking]: Detailed information about re-ranking top scoring documents from simple queries using more complex scores.

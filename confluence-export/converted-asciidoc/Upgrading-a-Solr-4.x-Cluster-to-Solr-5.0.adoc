Planning Your Upgrade
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here is a checklist of things you need to prepare before starting the upgrade process:

1.  Examine the link:Upgrading-Solr.html[Upgrading Solr] page to determine if any changes in Solr 5 will affect your installation.
2.  If not using replication, then you should make a backup of each collection. If all of your collections use replication, then you don't technically need to make a backup since you will be upgrading and verifying each node individually.
3.  Determine which Solr node is hosting the Overseer leader process in SolrCloud, as you should upgrade this node last. To determine the Overseer, use the Overseer Status API, see: link:Collections-API.html[Collections API].
4.  Plan to perform your upgrade during a system maintenance window if possible. You'll be doing a rolling restart of your cluster (each node, one-by-one), but we still recommend doing the upgrade when system usage is minimal.
5.  Verify the cluster is currently healthy and all replicas are active, as you should not perform an upgrade on a degraded cluster.
6.  Ensure your existing cluster is not using the legacy `solr.xml` format. If you are, then you need to migrate your existing cluster to use the new `solr.xml` format before proceeding, see: link:Moving-to-the-New-solr.xml-Format.html[Moving to the New solr.xml Format].
7.  Re-build all custom server-side components against Solr 5.0 JAR files.
8.  Determine the values of the following variables that are used by the Solr 5 start scripts:

* ** `ZK_HOST`: The ZooKeeper connection string your current SolrCloud nodes use to connect to ZooKeeper; this value will be the same for all nodes in the cluster.
** `SOLR_HOST`: The hostname each Solr node used to register with ZooKeeper when joining the SolrCloud cluster; this value will be used to set the *host* Java system property when starting the new Solr 5 process.
** `SOLR_PORT`: The port each Solr node is listening on, such as 8983.
** `SOLR_HOME`: The absolute path to the Solr home directory for each Solr node; this directory must contain a `solr.xml` file. This value will be passed to the new Solr 5 process using the `solr.solr.home` system property, see: link:Solr-Cores-and-solr.xml.html[Solr Cores and solr.xml]

You should now be ready to upgrade your cluster. Please verify this process in a test / staging cluster before doing it in production.

[[UpgradingaSolr4.xClustertoSolr5.0-UpgradeProcess]]
Upgrade Process
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The approach we recommend is to perform the upgrade of each Solr node, one-by-one. In other words, you will need to stop a node, upgrade it to 5.0, and restart it before moving on to the next node. This means that for a short period of time, there will be a mix of Solr 4.x and Solr 5.0 nodes running in your cluster. We also assume that you will point the new Solr 5 node to your existing Solr home directory where the Lucene index files are managed for each collection on the node. This means that you won't need to move any index files around to perform the upgrade. This also implies that you can apply this process to an existing install even if your current cluster runs on something other than the default Jetty container shipped with Solr 4.x. For instance, if your current cluster runs on Tomcat, you can still use this process to migrate to Solr 5 because you will simply point the new Solr 5 process at the existing Solr home used by Tomcat.

[[UpgradingaSolr4.xClustertoSolr5.0-Step1:StopSolr]]
Step 1: Stop Solr
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Begin by stopping the Solr node you want to upgrade. After stopping the node, if using replication, verify that all leaders hosted on the downed node have successfully migrated to other replicas; you can do this by visiting the Cloud panel in the Solr Admin UI. If not using replication, then any collections hosted on the downed node will be temporarily off-line.

[[UpgradingaSolr4.xClustertoSolr5.0-Step2:InstallSolr5asaService]]
Step 2: Install Solr 5 as a Service
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Please follow the instructions to install Solr as a Service on Linux documented at link:Taking-Solr-to-Production.html[Taking Solr to Production]. After running the install script, the new Solr 5 node will be running, so please stop it by doing: `sudo service solr stop`. You need to update the `/var/solr/solr.in.sh` include file to complete the upgrade process.

[[UpgradingaSolr4.xClustertoSolr5.0-Step3:SetEnvironmentVariableOverrides]]
Step 3: Set Environment Variable Overrides
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Open `/var/solr/solr.in.sh` with a text editor and set the following variables at the bottom of the include file:

`ZK_HOST=SOLR_HOST=SOLR_PORT=SOLR_HOME=`

You must set `SOLR_HOME` to an absolute path on your system and *_not_* use a path that includes a symbolic link due to a https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SOLR-7096[limitation] in the `/etc/init.d/solr` script. Also, make sure the user you plan to own the Solr process is the owner of the `SOLR_HOME` directory. For instance, if you plan to run Solr as the "solr" user and `SOLR_HOME` is `/var/solr/data`, then you would do: `sudo chown -R solr: /var/solr/data`

[[UpgradingaSolr4.xClustertoSolr5.0-Step4:StartSolr5]]
Step 4: Start Solr 5
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You are now ready to start the upgraded Solr 5 node by doing: `sudo service solr start`. The upgraded instance will join the existing cluster because you're using the same `SOLR_HOME`, `SOLR_PORT`, and `SOLR_HOST` settings used by the old Solr 4.x node; thus, the new server will look like the old node to the running cluster. Be sure to look in `/var/solr/logs/solr.log` for errors during startup.

[[UpgradingaSolr4.xClustertoSolr5.0-Step5:RunHealthcheck]]
Step 5: Run Healthcheck
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You should run the Solr *healthcheck* command for all collections that are hosted on the upgraded node before proceeding to upgrade the next node in your cluster. For instance, if the newly upgraded node hosts a replica for the *MyDocuments* collection, then you can run the following command (replace ZK_HOST with the ZooKeeper connection string):

----------------------------------------------------------
$ /opt/solr/bin/solr healthcheck -c MyDocuments -z ZK_HOST
----------------------------------------------------------

Look for any problems reported about any of the replicas for the collection.

Lastly, repeat Steps 1-5 for all nodes in your cluster.

Segments Info
-------------

The Segments Info screen lets you see a visualization of the various segments in the underlying Lucene index, with information about the size of each segment – both bytes and in number of documents – as well as other basic metadata about those segments, notably the number of deleted documents.

This information may be useful for people to help make decisions about the optimal link:IndexConfig-in-SolrConfig.html#IndexConfiginSolrConfig-MergingIndexSegments[merge settings] for their data.

Replication Screen
==================
:page-shortname: replication-screen
:page-permalink: replication-screen.html

The Replication screen shows you the current replication state for the core you have specified. link:solrcloud.html[SolrCloud] has supplanted much of this functionality, but if you are still using Master-Slave index replication, you can use this screen to:

1.  View the replicatable index state. (on a master node)
2.  View the current replication status (on a slave node)
3.  Disable replication. (on a master node)

Caution When Using SolrCloud

Note:

When using link:getting-started-with-solrcloud.html[SolrCloud], do not attempt to disable replication via this screen.

More details on how to configure replication is available in the section called link:index-replication.html[Index Replication].

This section describes how to set up distribution and replication in Solr. It is considered "legacy" behavior, since while it is still supported in Solr, the SolrCloud functionality described in the previous chapter is where the current development is headed. However, if you don't need all that SolrCloud delivers, search distribution and index replication may be sufficient.

This section covers the following topics:

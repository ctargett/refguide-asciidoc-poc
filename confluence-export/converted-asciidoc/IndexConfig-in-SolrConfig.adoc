IndexConfig in SolrConfig
-------------------------

The `<indexConfig>` section of `solrconfig.xml` defines low-level behavior of the Lucene index writers. By default, the settings are commented out in the sample `solrconfig.xml` included with Solr, which means the defaults are used. In most cases, the defaults are fine.

<indexConfig>

</indexConfig>

[[IndexConfiginSolrConfig-SizingIndexSegments]]
Sizing Index Segments
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[[IndexConfiginSolrConfig-ramBufferSizeMB]]
`ramBufferSizeMB`
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Once accumulated document updates exceed this much memory space (defined in megabytes), then the pending updates are flushed. This can also create new segments or trigger a merge. Using this setting is generally preferable to `maxBufferedDocs`. If both `maxBufferedDocs` and `ramBufferSizeMB` are set in `solrconfig.xml`, then a flush will occur when either limit is reached. The default is 100Mb.

--------------------------------------
<ramBufferSizeMB>100</ramBufferSizeMB>
--------------------------------------

[[IndexConfiginSolrConfig-maxBufferedDocs]]
`maxBufferedDocs`
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Sets the number of document updates to buffer in memory before they are flushed as a new segment. This may also trigger a merge. The default Solr configuration sets to flush by RAM usage (`ramBufferSizeMB`).

---------------------------------------
<maxBufferedDocs>1000</maxBufferedDocs>
---------------------------------------

[[IndexConfiginSolrConfig-maxIndexingThreads]]
`maxIndexingThreads`
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The maximum number of simultaneous threads used to index documents. Once this threshold is reached, additional threads will wait for the others to finish. The default is 8.

------------------------------------------
<maxIndexingThreads>8</maxIndexingThreads>
------------------------------------------

[[IndexConfiginSolrConfig-UseCompoundFile]]
`UseCompoundFile`
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Setting `<useCompoundFile>` to *true* combines the various files of each index segment into a single file. On systems where the number of open files allowed per process is limited, setting this to *true* may avoid hitting that limit (the open files limit might also be tunable for your OS with the Linux/Unix `ulimit` command, or something similar for other operating systems).

Updating a compound index may incur a minor performance hit for various reasons, depending on the runtime environment. For example, filesystem buffers are typically associated with open file descriptors, which may limit the total cache space available to each index.

This setting may also affect how much data needs to be transferred during index replication operations.

The default is **false**.

----------------------------------------
<useCompoundFile>false</useCompoundFile>
----------------------------------------

useCompountFile and noCFSRatio

Note:

Users who set the `<useCompoundFile>` option to true should also carefully consider whether they want to set the `noCFSRatio` on their `<mergePolicy>` as well. Many `MergePolicy` implementations have default values for this setting that prevent compound files from being used for large segments.

[[IndexConfiginSolrConfig-MergingIndexSegments]]
Merging Index Segments
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[[IndexConfiginSolrConfig-mergePolicy]]
`mergePolicy`
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Defines how merging segments is done. The default in Solr is `TieredMergePolicy`, which merges segments of approximately equal size, subject to an allowed number of segments per tier. Other policies available are the `LogByteSizeMergePolicy` and `LogDocMergePolicy`. For more information on these policies, please see http://lucene.apache.org/core/5_3_0/core/org/apache/lucene/index/MergePolicy.html[the MergePolicy javadocs].

---------------------------------------------------------------
<mergePolicy class="org.apache.lucene.index.TieredMergePolicy">
  <int name="maxMergeAtOnce">10</int>
  <int name="segmentsPerTier">10</int>
</mergePolicy>
---------------------------------------------------------------

[[IndexConfiginSolrConfig-mergeFactor]]
`mergeFactor`
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For the LogByteSizeMergePolicy, or the (default) TieredMergePolicy, the `<mergeFactor>` configuration option can be used as a convenience setting to indicate how many segments a Lucene index is allowed to merge at one time. It is equivalent to setting either `<int name="mergeFactor">` on the LogByteSizeMergePolicy, or setting both `<int name="maxMergeAtOnce">` and `<int name="segmentsPerTier">` (to the same value) on the TieredMergePolicy.

To understand why a mergeFactor is important, consider what happens when an update is made to an index: Documents are always added to the most recently opened segment. When a segment fills up, a new segment is created and subsequent updates are placed there. If creating a new segment would cause the number of lowest-level segments to exceed the `mergeFactor` value, then all those segments are merged together to form a single large segment. Thus, if the merge factor is 10, each merge results in the creation of a single segment that is roughly ten times larger than each of its ten constituents. When there are 10 of these larger segments, then they in turn are merged into an even larger single segment. This process can continue indefinitely.

Choosing the best merge factor is generally a trade-off of indexing speed vs. searching speed. Having fewer segments in the index generally accelerates searches, because there are fewer places to look. It also can also result in fewer physical files on disk. But to keep the number of segments low, merges will occur more often, which can add load to the system and slow down updates to the index.

Conversely, keeping more segments can accelerate indexing, because merges happen less often, making an update is less likely to trigger a merge. But searches become more computationally expensive and will likely be slower, because search terms must be looked up in more index segments. Faster index updates also means shorter commit turnaround times, which means more timely search results.

The default behavior of both LogByteSizeMergePolicy and TieredMergePolicy is an effective `mergeFactor` of 10:

-----------------------------
<mergeFactor>10</mergeFactor>
-----------------------------

[[IndexConfiginSolrConfig-mergeScheduler]]
`mergeScheduler`
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The merge scheduler controls how merges are performed. The default `ConcurrentMergeScheduler` performs merges in the background using separate threads. The alternative, `SerialMergeScheduler`, does not perform merges with separate threads.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
<mergeScheduler class="org.apache.lucene.index.ConcurrentMergeScheduler"/>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

[[IndexConfiginSolrConfig-mergedSegmentWarmer]]
`mergedSegmentWarmer`
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When using Solr in for link:Near-Real-Time-Searching.html[Near Real Time Searching] a merged segment warmer can be configured to warm the reader on the newly merged segment, before the merge commits. This is not required for near real-time search, but will reduce search latency on opening a new near real-time reader after a merge completes.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<mergedSegmentWarmer class="org.apache.lucene.index.SimpleMergedSegmentWarmer"/>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[[IndexConfiginSolrConfig-checkIntegrityAtMerge]]
`checkIntegrityAtMerge`
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If set to `true`, any actions that result in merging segments will first trigger an integrity check using checksums stored in the index segments (if available). If the checksums are not correct, the merge will fail and throw an Exception. (defaults to "`false`" for backwards compatibility)

---------------------------------------------------
<checkIntegrityAtMerge>true</checkIntegrityAtMerge>
---------------------------------------------------

[[IndexConfiginSolrConfig-IndexLocks]]
Index Locks
~~~~~~~~~~~

[[IndexConfiginSolrConfig-lockType]]
`lockType`
^^^^^^^^^^

The LockFactory options specify the locking implementation to use.

The set of valid lock type options depends on the link:DataDir-and-DirectoryFactory-in-SolrConfig.html[DirectoryFactory] you have configured. The values listed below are are supported by `StandardDirectoryFactory` (the default):

* `native` (default) uses NativeFSLockFactory to specify native OS file locking. If a second Solr process attempts to access the directory, it will fail. Do not use when multiple Solr web applications are attempting to share a single index.
* `simple` uses SimpleFSLockFactory to specify a plain file for locking.
* `single` (expert) uses SingleInstanceLockFactory. Use for special situations of a read-only index directory, or when there is no possibility of more than one process trying to modify the index (even sequentially). This type will protect against multiple cores within the _same_ JVM attempting to access the same index. WARNING! If multiple Solr instances in different JVMs modify an index, this type will _not_ protect against index corruption.
* `hdfs` uses HdfsLockFactory to support reading and writing index and transaction log files to a HDFS filesystem. See the section link:Running-Solr-on-HDFS.html[Running Solr on HDFS] for more details on using this feature.

For more information on the nuances of each LockFactory, see http://wiki.apache.org/lucene-java/AvailableLockFactories.

---------------------------
<lockType>native</lockType>
---------------------------

[[IndexConfiginSolrConfig-unlockOnStartup]]
`unlockOnStartup`
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As of Solr 5.3, this property has no effect and is not supported any longer.

If using `simple` or `hdfs` lock type, you may need to unlock manually. To do this, simply delete the lock file in Solr's index directory.

[[IndexConfiginSolrConfig-writeLockTimeout]]
`writeLockTimeout`
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The maximum time to wait for a write lock on an IndexWriter. The default is 1000, expressed in milliseconds.

-----------------------------------------
<writeLockTimeout>1000</writeLockTimeout>
-----------------------------------------

[[IndexConfiginSolrConfig-OtherIndexingSettings]]
Other Indexing Settings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are a few other parameters that may be important to configure for your implementation. These settings affect how or when updates are made to an index.

[width="100%",cols="50%,50%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================
|Setting |Description
|reopenReaders |Controls if IndexReaders will be re-opened, instead of closed and then opened, which is often less efficient. The default is true.
|deletionPolicy |Controls how commits are retained in case of rollback. The default is `SolrDeletionPolicy`, which has sub-parameters for the maximum number of commits to keep (`maxCommitsToKeep`), the maximum number of optimized commits to keep (`maxOptimizedCommitsToKeep`), and the maximum age of any commit to keep (`maxCommitAge`), which supports `DateMathParser` syntax.
|infoStream |The InfoStream setting instructs the underlying Lucene classes to write detailed debug information from the indexing process as Solr log messages.

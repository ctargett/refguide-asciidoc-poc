When Solr RequestHandlers are accessed using path based URLs, the `SolrQueryRequest` object containing the parameters of the request may also contain a list of ContentStreams containing bulk data for the request. (The name SolrQueryRequest is a bit misleading: it is involved in all requests, regardless of whether it is a query request or an update request.)

[[ContentStreams-StreamSources]]
== Stream Sources

Currently RequestHandlers can get content streams in a variety of ways:

* For multipart file uploads, each file is passed as a stream.
* For POST requests where the content-type is not `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`, the raw POST body is passed as a stream. The full POST body is parsed as parameters and included in the Solr parameters.
* The contents of parameter `stream.body` is passed as a stream.
* If remote streaming is enabled and URL content is called for during request handling, the contents of each `stream.url` and `stream.file` parameters are fetched and passed as a stream.

By default, curl sends a `contentType="application/x-www-form-urlencoded"` header. If you need to test a SolrContentHeader content stream, you will need to set the content type with the "-H" flag.

[[ContentStreams-RemoteStreaming]]
== RemoteStreaming

Remote streaming lets you send the contents of a URL as a stream to a given SolrRequestHandler. You could use remote streaming to send a remote or local file to an update plugin. For convenience, remote streaming is enabled in most of the example `solrconfig.xml` files included with Solr, however it is not recommended in a production situation with out additional security between you and untrusted remote clients.

[source,java]
----
    <!-- *** WARNING ***
         The settings below authorize Solr to fetch remote files, You
         should make sure your system has some authentication before
         using enableRemoteStreaming="true"
      --> 
    <requestParsers enableRemoteStreaming="true" />
----

The default behavior, when `enableRemoteStreaming` is not specified in `solrconfig.xml` is to _not_ allow remote streaming (i.e., `enableRemoteStreaming="false"`).

[WARNING]
====

If you `enableRemoteStreaming="true"` is used, be aware that this allows _anyone_ to send a request to any URL or local file. If <<ContentStreams-DebuggingRequests,DumpRequestHandler>> is enabled, it will allow anyone to view any file on your system.

====

[[ContentStreams-DebuggingRequests]]
== Debugging Requests

The example `solrconfig.xml` files include a "dump" RequestHandler:

[source,java]
----
<requestHandler name="/debug/dump" class="solr.DumpRequestHandler" />
----

This handler simply outputs the contents of the SolrQueryRequest using the specified writer type `wt`. This is a useful tool to help understand what streams are available to the RequestHandlers.

Core Specific Tools
-------------------

In the left-hand navigation bar, you will see a pull-down menu titled "Core Selector". Clicking on the menu will show a list of Solr cores, with a search box that can be used to find a specific core (handy if you have a lot of cores). When you select a core, a secondary menu opens under the core name with the administration options available for that particular core.

After selecting the core, the central part of the screen shows Statistics and other information about the core you chose. You can define a file called `admin-extra.html` that includes links or other information you would like to display in the "Admin Extra" part of this main screen.

On the left side, under the core name, are links to other screens that display information or provide options for the specific core chosen. The core-specific options are listed below, with a link to the section of this Guide to find out more:

* link:Analysis-Screen.html[Analysis] - lets you analyze the data found in specific fields.
* link:Dataimport-Screen.html[Dataimport] - shows you information about the current status of the Data Import Handler.
* link:Documents-Screen.html[Documents] - provides a simple form allowing you to execute various Solr indexing commands directly from the browser.
* link:Files-Screen.html[Files] - shows the current core configuration files such as `solrconfig.xml` and `schema.xml`.
* link:Ping.html[Ping] - lets you ping a named core and determine whether the core is active.
* link:32604180.html[Plugins/Stats] - shows statistics for plugins and other installed components.
* link:Query-Screen.html[Query] - lets you submit a structured query about various elements of a core.
* link:Replication-Screen.html[Replication] - shows you the current replication status for the core, and lets you enable/disable replication.
* link:Schema-Browser-Screen.html[Schema Browser] - displays schema data in a browser window.
* link:Segments-Info.html[Segments Info] - Provides a visualization of the underlying Lucene index segments.

DocValues
---------

DocValues are a way of recording field values internally that is more efficient for some purposes, such as sorting and faceting, then traditional indexing.

[[DocValues-WhyDocValues?]]
Why DocValues?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The standard way that Solr builds the index is with an __inverted index__. This style builds a list of terms found in all the documents in the index and next to each term is a list of documents that the term appears in (as well as how many times the term appears in that document). This makes search very fast - since users search by terms, having a ready list of term-to-document values makes the query process faster.

For other features that we now commonly associate with search, such as sorting, faceting, and highlighting, this approach is not very efficient. The faceting engine, for example, must look up each term that appears in each document that will make up the result set and pull the document IDs in order to build the facet list. In Solr, this is maintained in memory, and can be slow to load (depending on the number of documents, terms, etc.).

In Lucene 4.0, a new approach was introduced. DocValue fields are now column-oriented fields with a document-to-value mapping built at index time. This approach promises to relieve some of the memory requirements of the fieldCache and make lookups for faceting, sorting, and grouping much faster.

[[DocValues-HowtoUseDocValues]]
How to Use DocValues
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To use docValues, you only need to enable it for a field that you will use it with. As with all schema design, you need to define a field type and then define fields of that type with docValues enabled. All of these actions are done in `schema.xml`.

Enabling a field for docValues only requires adding `docValues="true"` to the field (or field type) definition, as in this example from the `schema.xml` of Solr's `sample_techproducts_configs` link:Config-Sets.html[config set]:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<field name="manu_exact" type="string" indexed="false" stored="false" docValues="true" />
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note:

If you have already indexed data into your Solr index, you will need to completely re-index your content after changing your field definitions in `schema.xml` in order to successfully use docValues.

DocValues are only available for specific field types. The types chosen determine the underlying Lucene docValue type that will be used. The available Solr field types are:

* `StrField` and `UUIDField`.
** If the field is single-valued (i.e., multi-valued is false), Lucene will use the SORTED type.
** If the field is multi-valued, Lucene will use the SORTED_SET type.
* Any `Trie*` numeric fields and `EnumField`.
** If the field is single-valued (i.e., multi-valued is false), Lucene will use the NUMERIC type.
** If the field is multi-valued, Lucene will use the SORTED_SET type.

These Lucene types are related to how the values are sorted and stored.

There is an additional configuration option available, which is to modify the `docValuesFormat` link:Field-Type-Definitions-and-Properties.html#FieldTypeDefinitionsandProperties-docValuesFormat[used by the field type]. The default implementation employs a mixture of loading some things into memory and keeping some on disk. In some cases, however, you may choose to specify an alternative http://lucene.apache.org/core/5_3_0/core/org/apache/lucene/codecs/DocValuesFormat.html[DocValuesFormat implementation]. For example, you could choose to keep everything in memory by specifying `docValuesFormat="Memory"` on a field type:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<fieldType name="string_in_mem_dv" class="solr.StrField" docValues="true" docValuesFormat="Memory" />
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Please note that the `docValuesFormat` option may change in future releases.

Note:

Lucene index back-compatibility is only supported for the default codec. If you choose to customize the `docValuesFormat` in your schema.xml, upgrading to a future version of Solr may require you to either switch back to the default codec and optimize your index to rewrite it into the default codec before upgrading, or re-build your entire index from scratch after upgrading.

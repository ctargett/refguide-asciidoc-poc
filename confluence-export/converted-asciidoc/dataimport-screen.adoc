The Dataimport screen shows the configuration of the DataImportHandler (DIH) and allows you start, and monitor the status of, import commands as defined by the options selected on the screen and defined in the configuration file.

This screen also lets you adjust various options to control how the data is imported to Solr, and view the data import configuration file that controls the import. For more information about data importing with DIH, see the section on link:uploading-structured-data-store-data-with-the-data-import-handler.html[Uploading Structured Data Store Data with the Data Import Handler].

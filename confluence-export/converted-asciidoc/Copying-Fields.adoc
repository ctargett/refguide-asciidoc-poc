Copying Fields
--------------

You might want to interpret some document fields in more than one way. Solr has a mechanism for making copies of fields so that you can apply several distinct field types to a single piece of incoming information.

The name of the field you want to copy is the __source__, and the name of the copy is the __destination__. In `schema.xml`, it's very simple to make copies of fields:

-------------------------------------------------------
<copyField source="cat" dest="text" maxChars="30000" />
-------------------------------------------------------

If the `text` destination field has data of its own in the input documents, the contents of the `cat` field will be added as additional values â€“ just as if all of the values had originally been specified by the client. Remember to configure your fields as `multivalued="true"` if they will ultimately get multiple values (either from a multivalued source, or multiple `copyField` directives, etc...)

The `maxChars` parameter, an `int` parameter, establishes an upper limit for the number of characters to be copied from the source value when constructing the value added to the destination field. This limit is useful for situations in which you want to copy some data from the source field, but also control the size of index files.

Both the source and the destination of `copyField` can contain either leading or trailing asterisks, which will match anything. For example, the following line will copy the contents of all incoming fields that match the wildcard pattern `*_t` to the text field.:

-------------------------------------------------------
<copyField source="*_t" dest="text" maxChars="25000" />
-------------------------------------------------------

Note:

The `copyField` command can use a wildcard (*) character in the `dest` parameter only if the `source` parameter contains one as well. `copyField` uses the matching glob from the source field for the `dest` field name into which the source content is copied.

Taking Solr to Production
-------------------------

This section provides guidance on how to setup Solr to run in production on *nix platforms, such as Ubuntu. Specifically, we’ll walk through the process of setting up to run a single Solr instance on a Linux host and then provide tips on how to support multiple Solr nodes running on the same host.

[[TakingSolrtoProduction-ServiceInstallationScript]]
Service Installation Script
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Solr includes a service installation script (`bin/install_solr_service.sh`) to help you install Solr as a service on Linux. Currently, the script only supports Red Hat, Ubuntu, Debian, and SUSE Linux distributions. Before running the script, you need to determine a few parameters about your setup. Specifically, you need to decide where to install Solr and which system user should be the owner of the Solr files and process.

[[TakingSolrtoProduction-Planningyourdirectorystructure]]
Planning your directory structure
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We recommend separating your live Solr files, such as logs and index files, from the files included in the Solr distribution bundle, as that makes it easier to upgrade Solr and is considered a good practice to follow as a system administrator.

[[TakingSolrtoProduction-SolrInstallationDirectory]]
Solr Installation Directory
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

By default, the service installation script will extract the distribution archive into `/opt`. You can change this location using the `-i` option when running the installation script. The script will also create a symbolic link to the versioned directory of Solr. For instance, if you run the installation script for Solr 5.0.0, then the following directory structure will be used:

----------------------------
/opt/solr-5.0.0
/opt/solr -> /opt/solr-5.0.0
----------------------------

Using a symbolic link insulates any scripts from being dependent on the specific Solr version. If, down the road, you need to upgrade to a later version of Solr, you can just update the symbolic link to point to the upgraded version of Solr. We’ll use `/opt/solr` to refer to the Solr installation directory in the remaining sections of this page.

[[TakingSolrtoProduction-SeparateDirectoryforWritableFiles]]
Separate Directory for Writable Files
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

You should also separate writable Solr files into a different directory; by default, the installation script uses `/var/solr`, but you can override this location using the `-d` option. With this approach, the files in `/opt/solr` will remain untouched and all files that change while Solr is running will live under `/var/solr`.

[[TakingSolrtoProduction-CreatetheSolruser]]
Create the Solr user
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Running Solr as `root` is not recommended for security reasons. Consequently, you should determine the username of a system user that will own all of the Solr files and the running Solr process. By default, the installation script will create the *solr* user, but you can override this setting using the -u option. If your organization has specific requirements for creating new user accounts, then you should create the user before running the script. The installation script will make the Solr user the owner of the `/opt/solr` and `/var/solr` directories.

You are now ready to run the installation script.

[[TakingSolrtoProduction-RuntheSolrInstallationScript]]
Run the Solr Installation Script
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To run the script, you'll need to download the latest Solr 5.x distribution archive and then do the following (NOTE: replace `solr-5.0.0` with the actual version number):

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ tar xzf solr-5.0.0.tgz solr-5.0.0/bin/install_solr_service.sh --strip-components=2
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The previous command extracts the `install_solr_service.sh` script from the archive into the current directory. If installing on Red Hat, please make sure *lsof* is installed before running the Solr installation script (`sudo yum install lsof`). The installation script must be run as root:

----------------------------------------------------
$ sudo bash ./install_solr_service.sh solr-5.0.0.tgz
----------------------------------------------------

By default, the script extracts the distribution archive into `/opt`, configures Solr to write files into `/var/solr`, and runs Solr as the `solr` user. Consequently, the following command produces the same result as the previous command:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ sudo bash ./install_solr_service.sh solr-5.0.0.tgz -i /opt -d /var/solr -u solr -s solr -p 8983
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can customize the service name, installation directories, port, and owner using options passed to the installation script. To see available options, simply do:

-------------------------------------------
$ sudo bash ./install_solr_service.sh -help
-------------------------------------------

Once the script completes, Solr will be installed as a service and running in the background on your server (on port 8983). To verify, you can do:

--------------------------
$ sudo service solr status
--------------------------

We'll cover some additional configuration settings you can make to fine-tune your Solr setup in a moment. Before moving on, let's take a closer look at the steps performed by the installation script. This gives you a better overview and will help you understand important details about your Solr installation when reading other pages in this guide; such as when a page refers to Solr home, you'll know exactly where that is on your system.

[[TakingSolrtoProduction-SolrHomeDirectory]]
Solr Home Directory
+++++++++++++++++++

The Solr home directory (not to be confused with the Solr installation directory) is where Solr manages core directories with index files. By default, the installation script uses `/var/solr/data`. Take a moment to inspect the contents of the Solr home directory on your system. If you do notlink:Using-ZooKeeper-to-Manage-Configuration-Files.html[store `solr.xml` in ZooKeeper], the home directory must contain a `solr.xml` file. When Solr starts up, the Solr start script passes the location of the home directory using the `-Dsolr.solr.home `system property.

[[TakingSolrtoProduction-Environmentoverridesincludefile]]
Environment overrides include file
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The service installation script creates an environment specific include file that overrides defaults used by the `bin/solr` script. The main advantage of using an include file is that it provides a single location where all of your environment-specific overrides are defined. Take a moment to inspect the contents of the `/var/solr/solr.in.sh` file, which is the default path setup by the installation script. There are many settings that you can override using this file. However, at a minimum, this script needs to define the `SOLR_PID_DIR` and `SOLR_HOME` variables, such as:

------------------------
SOLR_PID_DIR=/var/solr
SOLR_HOME=/var/solr/data
------------------------

The `SOLR_PID_DIR` variable sets the directory where the start script will write out a file containing the Solr server’s process ID.

[[TakingSolrtoProduction-Logsettings]]
Log settings
++++++++++++

Solr uses Apache Log4J for logging. The installation script copies `/opt/solr/server/resources/log4j.properties` to `/var/solr/log4j.properties` and customizes it for your environment. Specifically it updates the Log4J settings to create logs in the `/var/solr/logs` directory. Take a moment to verify that the Solr include file is configured to send logs to the correct location by checking the following settings in `/var/solr/solr.in.sh` :

--------------------------------------
LOG4J_PROPS=/var/solr/log4j.properties
SOLR_LOGS_DIR=/var/solr/logs
--------------------------------------

For more information about Log4J configuration, please see: link:Configuring-Logging.html[Configuring Logging]

[[TakingSolrtoProduction-init.dscript]]
init.d script
+++++++++++++

When running a service like Solr on Linux, it’s common to setup an init.d script so that system administrators can control Solr using the service tool, such as: `service solr start`. The installation script creates a very basic init.d script to help you get started. Take a moment to inspect the `/etc/init.d/solr` script and notice that the following variables are setup for your environment based on the parameters passed to the installation script:

-----------------------------
SOLR_INSTALL_DIR=/opt/solr
SOLR_ENV=/var/solr/solr.in.sh
RUNAS=solr
-----------------------------

The `SOLR_INSTALL_DIR` and `SOLR_ENV` variables should be self-explanatory. The `RUNAS` variable sets the owner of the Solr process, such as `solr`; if you don’t set this value, the script will run Solr as **root**, which is not recommended for production. You can use the `/etc/init.d/solr` script to start Solr by doing the following as root:

--------------------
# service solr start
--------------------

The `/etc/init.d/solr` script also supports the **stop**, **restart**, and *status* commands. Please keep in mind that the init script that ships with Solr is very basic and is intended to show you how to setup Solr as a service. However, it’s also common to use more advanced tools like *supervisord* or *upstart* to control Solr as a service on Linux. While showing how to integrate Solr with tools like supervisord is beyond the scope of this guide, the `init.d/solr` script should provide enough guidance to help you get started. Also, the installation script sets the Solr service to start automatically when the host machine initializes.

[[TakingSolrtoProduction-ProgressCheck]]
Progress Check
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the next section, we cover some additional environment settings to help you fine-tune your production setup. However, before we move on, let's review what we've achieved thus far. Specifically, you should be able to control Solr using `/etc/init.d/solr`. Please verify the following commands work with your setup:

---------------------------
$ sudo service solr restart
$ sudo service solr status
---------------------------

The status command should give some basic information about the running Solr node that looks similar to:

---------------------------------------------------
Solr process PID running on port 8983
{
  "version":"5.0.0 - ubuntu - 2014-12-17 19:36:58",
  "startTime":"2014-12-19T19:25:46.853Z",
  "uptime":"0 days, 0 hours, 0 minutes, 8 seconds",
  "memory":"85.4 MB (%17.4) of 490.7 MB"}
---------------------------------------------------

If the `status` command is not successful, look for error messages in `/var/solr/logs/solr.log`.

[[TakingSolrtoProduction-Finetuneyourproductionsetup]]
Fine tune your production setup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[[TakingSolrtoProduction-MemoryandGCSettings]]
Memory and GC Settings
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

By default, the `bin/solr` script sets the maximum Java heap size to 512M (-Xmx512m), which is fine for getting started with Solr. For production, you’ll want to increase the maximum heap size based on the memory requirements of your search application; values between 10 and 20 gigabytes are not uncommon for production servers. When you need to change the memory settings for your Solr server, use the `SOLR_JAVA_MEM` variable in the include file, such as:

-------------------------------
SOLR_JAVA_MEM="-Xms10g -Xmx10g"
-------------------------------

Also, the include file comes with a set of pre-configured Java Garbage Collection settings that have shown to work well with Solr for a number of different workloads. However, these settings may not work well for your specific use of Solr. Consequently, you may need to change the GC settings, which should also be done with the `GC_TUNE` variable in the `/var/solr/solr.in.sh` include file. For more information about tuning your memory and garbage collection settings, see: link:JVM-Settings.html[JVM Settings].

[[TakingSolrtoProduction-Out-of-MemoryShutdownHook]]
Out-of-Memory Shutdown Hook
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The `bin/solr` script registers the `bin/oom_solr.sh` script to be called by the JVM if an OutOfMemoryError occurs. The `oom_solr.sh` script will issue a `kill -9` to the Solr process that experiences the `OutOfMemoryError`. This behavior is recommended when running in SolrCloud mode so that ZooKeeper is immediately notified that a node has experienced a non-recoverable error. Take a moment to inspect the contents of the `/opt/solr/bin/oom_solr.sh` script so that you are familiar with the actions the script will perform if it is invoked by the JVM.

[[TakingSolrtoProduction-SolrCloud]]
SolrCloud
^^^^^^^^^

To run Solr in SolrCloud mode, you need to set the `ZK_HOST` variable in the include file to point to your ZooKeeper ensemble. Running the embedded ZooKeeper is not supported in production environments. For instance, if you have a ZooKeeper ensemble hosted on the following three hosts on the default client port 2181 (zk1, zk2, and zk3), then you would set:

-------------------
ZK_HOST=zk1,zk2,zk3
-------------------

When the `ZK_HOST` variable is set, Solr will launch in "cloud" mode.

[[TakingSolrtoProduction-ZooKeeperchroot]]
ZooKeeper chroot
++++++++++++++++

If you're using a ZooKeeper instance that is shared by other systems, it's recommended to isolate the SolrCloud znode tree using ZooKeeper's chroot support. For instance, to ensure all znodes created by SolrCloud are stored under `/solr`, you can put `/solr` on the end of your `ZK_HOST` connection string, such as:

------------------------
ZK_HOST=zk1,zk2,zk3/solr
------------------------

Before using a chroot for the first time, you need to create the root path (znode) in ZooKeeper by using the `zkcli.sh` script. We can use the makepath command for that:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ server/scripts/cloud-scripts/zkcli.sh -zkhost zk1,zk2,zk3 -cmd makepath /solr
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note:

If you also want to bootstrap ZooKeeper with existing `solr_home`, you can instead use use `zkcli`s `bootstrap` command, which will also create the chroot path if it does not exist. See link:Command-Line-Utilities.html[Command Line Utilities]for more info.

[[TakingSolrtoProduction-SolrHostname]]
Solr Hostname
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Use the `SOLR_HOST` variable in the include file to set the hostname of the Solr server.

---------------------------
SOLR_HOST=solr1.example.com
---------------------------

Setting the hostname of the Solr server is recommended, especially when running in SolrCloud mode, as this determines the address of the node when it registers with ZooKeeper.

[[TakingSolrtoProduction-Overridesettingsinsolrconfig.xml]]
Override settings in solrconfig.xml
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Solr allows configuration properties to be overridden using Java system properties passed at startup using the `-Dproperty=value` syntax. For instance, in `solrconfig.xml`, the default auto soft commit settings are set to:

------------------------------------------------------
<autoSoftCommit>
  <maxTime>${solr.autoSoftCommit.maxTime:-1}</maxTime>
</autoSoftCommit>
------------------------------------------------------

In general, whenever you see a property in a Solr configuration file that uses the `${solr.PROPERTY:DEFAULT_VALUE}` syntax, then you know it can be overridden using a Java system property. For instance, to set the maxTime for soft-commits to be 10 seconds, then you can start Solr with `-Dsolr.autoSoftCommit.maxTime=10000`, such as:

----------------------------------------------------
$ bin/solr start -Dsolr.autoSoftCommit.maxTime=10000
----------------------------------------------------

The `bin/solr` script simply passes options starting with `-D` on to the JVM during startup. For running in production, we recommend setting these properties in the `SOLR_OPTS` variable defined in the include file. Keeping with our soft-commit example, in `/var/solr/solr.in.sh`, you would do:

----------------------------------------------------------
SOLR_OPTS="$SOLR_OPTS -Dsolr.autoSoftCommit.maxTime=10000"
----------------------------------------------------------

[[TakingSolrtoProduction-EnableRemoteJMXAccess]]
Enable Remote JMX Access
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you need to attach a JMX-enabled Java profiling tool, such as JConsole or VisualVM, to a remote Solr server, then you need to enable remote JMX access when starting the Solr server. Simply change the `ENABLE_REMOTE_JMX_OPTS` property in the include file to true. You’ll also need to choose a port for the JMX RMI connector to bind to, such as 18983. For example, if your Solr include script sets:

---------------------------
ENABLE_REMOTE_JMX_OPTS=true
RMI_PORT=18983
---------------------------

The JMX RMI connector will allow Java profiling tools to attach to port 18983. When enabled, the following properties are passed to the JVM when starting Solr:

---------------------------------------------------
-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote \
-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.local.only=false \
-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.ssl=false \
-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.authenticate=false \
-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.port=18983 \
-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.rmi.port=18983
---------------------------------------------------

We don’t recommend enabling remote JMX access in production, but it can sometimes be useful when doing performance and user-acceptance testing prior to going into production.

[[TakingSolrtoProduction-RunningmultipleSolrnodesperhost]]
Running multiple Solr nodes per host
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The `bin/solr` script was designed to allow you to run multiple Solr nodes on the same host. At a minimum, you will need unique Solr home directories for each node you want to run; ideally, each home should be on a different physical disk so that multiple Solr nodes don’t have to compete with each other when accessing files on disk. Having different Solr home directories implies that you’ll need a different include file for each node. Moreover, if using the `/etc/init.d/solr` script to control Solr as a service, then you’ll need a separate script for each node. The easiest approach is to use the service installation script to add multiple services on the same host, such as:

---------------------------------------------------------------------
$ sudo bash ./install_solr_service.sh solr-5.0.0.tgz -s solr2 -p 8984
---------------------------------------------------------------------

The command shown above will add a service named `solr2` running on port 8984 using `/var/solr2` for writable (aka "live") files; the second server will still be owned and run by the `solr` user and will use the Solr distribution files in `/opt`. After installing the solr2 service, verify it works correctly by doing:

----------------------------
$ sudo service solr2 restart
$ sudo service solr2 status
----------------------------

The following sections cover provide general information about how various SolrCloud features work. To understand these features, it's important to first understand a few key concepts that relate to SolrCloud.

== Key SolrCloud Concepts

A SolrCloud cluster consists of some "logical" concepts layered on top of some "physical" concepts.

[[HowSolrCloudWorks-Logical]]
=== Logical

* A Cluster can host multiple Collections of Solr Documents.
* A collection can be partitioned into multiple Shards, which contain a subset of the Documents in the Collection.
* The number of Shards that a Collection has determines:
** The theoretical limit to the number of Documents that Collection can reasonably contain.
** The amount of parallelization that is possible for an individual search request.

[[HowSolrCloudWorks-Physical]]
=== Physical

* A Cluster is made up of one or more Solr Nodes, which are running instances of the Solr server process.
* Each Node can host multiple Cores.
* Each Core in a Cluster is a physical Replica for a logical Shard.
* Every Replica uses the same configuration specified for the Collection that it is a part of.
* The number of Replicas that each Shard has determines:
** The level of redundancy built into the Collection and how fault tolerant the Cluster can be in the event that some Nodes become unavailable.
** The theoretical limit in the number concurrent search requests that can be processed under heavy load.

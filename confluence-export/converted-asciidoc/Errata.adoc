Errata For Past Versions of This Documentation
----------------------------------------------

Any known mistakes in past releases of this documentation will be noted below.

*Using copyField directives with suggester:* Previous versions of this guide advocated using copyField directives to accumulate the contents on multiple fields into a single field to be used with Solr suggester components. This will not work previous to Solr 5.1; attempting to build the suggester will result in errors being reported in the logs if the field is multiValued. As a work-around, indexing clients should accumulate all of the contents into the field before sending the documents to Solr, and any fields used with the suggesters should have multiValued="false".

The *_variable_ facet.range.gap parameter* was included in documentation even though the patch was not committed. As of yet there is no ability to specify variable gaps via a comma-separated list for facet.range.gap. Some of this functionality can be achieved by interval faceting, see SOLR-6216

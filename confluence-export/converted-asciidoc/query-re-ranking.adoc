Query Re-Ranking
================

Query Re-Ranking allows you to run a simple query (A) for matching documents and then re-rank the top N documents using the scores from a more complex query (B). Since the more costly ranking from query B is only applied to the top N documents it will have less impact on performance then just using the complex query B by itself â€“ the trade off is that documents which score very low using the simple query A may not be considered during the re-ranking phase, even if they would score very highly using query B.

== Specifying A Ranking Query

A Ranking query can be specified using the "`rq`" request parameter. The "rq" parameter must specify a query string that when parsed, produces a RankQuery. This could also be done with a custom QParserPlugin you have written as a plugin, but most users can just use the "`rerank`" parser provided with Solr.

The "`rerank`" parser wraps a query specified by an local parameter, along with additional parameters indicating how many documents should be re-ranked, and how the final scores should be computed:

[width="100%",cols="34%,33%,33%",options="header",]
|==================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================
|Parameter |Default |Description
|`reRankQuery` |(Mandatory) |The query string for your complex ranking query - in most cases <<local-parameters-in-queries.adoc#,a variable>> will be used to refer to another request parameter.
|`reRankDocs` |200 |The number of top N documents from the original query that should be re-ranked. This number will be treated as a minimum, and may be increased internally automatically in order to rank enough documents to satisfy the query (ie: start+rows)
|`reRankWeight` |2.0 |A multiplicative factor that will be applied to the score from the reRankQuery for each of the top matching documents, before that score is added to the original score
|==================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

In the example below, the top 1000 documents matching the query "greetings" will be re-ranked using the query "(hi hello hey hiya)". The resulting scores for each of those 1000 documents will be 3 times their score from the "(hi hello hey hiya)", plus the score from the original "gretings" query:

[source,java]
----
q=greetings&rq={!rerank reRankQuery=$rqq reRankDocs=1000 reRankWeight=3}&rqq=(hi+hello+hey+hiya)
----

If a document matches the original query, but does not match the re-ranking query, the document's original score will remain.

== Combining Ranking Queries With Other Solr Features

The "`rq`" parameter and the re-ranking feature in general works well with other Solr features. For example, it can be used in conjunction with the <<collapse-and-expand-results.adoc#,collapse parser>> to re-rank the group heads after they've been collapsed. It also preserves the order of documents elevated by the <<the-query-elevation-component.adoc#,elevation component>>. And it even has it's own custom explain so you can see how the re-ranking scores were derived when looking at <<common-query-parameters.adoc#CommonQueryParameters-ThedebugParameter,debug information>>.

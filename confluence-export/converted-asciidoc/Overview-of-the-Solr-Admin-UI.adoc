Overview of the Solr Admin UI
-----------------------------

Solr features a Web interface that makes it easy for Solr administrators and programmers to view link:Files-Screen.html[Solr configuration] details, run link:Query-Screen.html[queries and analyze] document fields in order to fine-tune a Solr configuration and access link:Getting-Assistance.html[online documentation] and other help.

Accessing the URL `http://hostname:8983/solr/` will show the main dashboard, which is divided into two parts.

A left-side of the screen is a menu under the Solr logo that provides the navigation through the screens of the UI. The first set of links are for system-level information and configuration and provide access to Logging, Core Admin and Java Properties, among other things. At the end of this information is a list of Solr cores configured for this instance. Clicking on a core name shows a secondary menu of information and configuration options for the core specifically. Items in this list include the Schema, Config, Plugins, and an ability to perform Queries on indexed data.

The center of the screen shows the detail of the option selected. This may include a sub-navigation for the option or text or graphical representation of the requested data. See the sections in this guide for each screen for more details.

Under the covers, the Solr Admin UI re-uses the same HTTP APIs available to all clients to access Solr-related data to drive an external interface.

Note:

The path to the Solr Admin UI given above is `http://hostname:port/solr`, which redirects to `http://hostname:port/solr/#/` in the current version. A convenience redirect is also supported, so simply accessing the Admin UI at `http://hostname:port/` will also redirect to `http://hostname:port/solr/#/`.

Configuring the Admin UI in `solrconfig.xml`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can configure the Solr Admin UI by editing the file `solrconfig.xml`.

The `<admin>` block in the `solrconfig.xml` file determines the default query to be displayed in the Query section of the core-specific pages. The default is `*:*`, which is to find all documents. In this example, we have changed the default to the term `solr`.

-------------------------------------
<admin>
    <defaultQuery>solr</defaultQuery>
</admin>

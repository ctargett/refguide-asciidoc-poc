= Solr Ref Guide

This is the source for the Solr Reference Guide.

Raw content is stored in Asciidoc (`.adoc`) formated files in the `src/` directory.

These files are processed with AsciiDoctor in 2 different ways:

* Via 'Jekyll' to build an HTML browsable version of the Ref Guide
** NOTE: This currently requires that you have already installed `ruby`, `jekyll`, and the `jekyll-asciidoc` plugin locally
* Via `asciidoctor-ant` to build the officially released PDF version of the Ref Guide

For details on building the ref guide, see `ant -p`.

Key directories to be aware of:

* `src` - where all human edited `*.adoc` files realted to the Guide live, as well as various configuration, theme, and template files.
* `tools` - custom Java code for parsing metadata in our `src/*.adoc` files to produce some `_data/` files for site & pdf navigation purposes.
* `build/content` - a copy of the `src` dir generated by ant where:
** `*.template` files are processed to replace ant properties with their runtime values
** some `build/content/_data` files are generated by our java tools based header attributes from each of the `*.adoc` files
* `build/html-site` - HTML generated version of the ref guide
* `build/apache-solr-ref-guide-X.Y.pdf` - PDF generated version of the ref guide

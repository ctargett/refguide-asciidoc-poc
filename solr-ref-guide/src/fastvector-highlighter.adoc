:page-shortname: fastvector-highlighter
:page-permalink: fastvector-highlighter.html

The FastVectorHighlighter is a TermVector-based highlighter that offers higher performance than the standard highlighter in many cases. To use the FastVectorHighlighter, set the `hl.useFastVectorHighlighter` parameter to `true`.

You must also turn on `termVectors`, `termPositions`, and `termOffsets` for each field that will be highlighted. Lastly, you should use a boundary scanner to prevent the FastVectorHighlighter from truncating your terms. In most cases, using the `breakIterator` boundary scanner will give you excellent results. See the section <<FastVectorHighlighter-UsingBoundaryScannerswiththeFastVectorHighlighter,Using Boundary Scanners with the Fast Vector Highlighter>> for more details about boundary scanners.

== FastVector Highlighter Parameters

The table below describes Solr's parameters for this highlighter, many of which overlap with the standard highlighter. These parameters can be defined in the highlight search component, as defaults for the specific request handler, or passed to the request handler with the query.

[width="100%",cols="34%,33%,33%",options="header",]
|===
|Parameter |Default |Description
|hl |blank (no highlighting) |When set to **true**, enables highlighted snippets to be generated in the query response. A *false* or blank value disables highlighting.
|hl.useFastVectorHighlighter |false |When set to **true**, enables the FastVector Highlighter.
|hl.q |blank |Specifies an overriding query term for highlighting. If `hl.q` is specified, the highlighter will use that term rather than the main query term.
|hl.fl |blank |Specifies a list of fields to highlight. Accepts a comma- or space-delimited list of fields for which Solr should generate highlighted snippets. If left blank, highlights the defaultSearchField (or the field specified the `df` parameter if used) for the StandardRequestHandler. For the DisMaxRequestHandler, the `qf` fields are used as defaults. +
 +
A '*' can be used to match field globs, such as 'text_*' or even '*' to highlight on all fields where highlighting is possible. When using '*', consider adding `hl.requireFieldMatch=true`.
|hl.snippets |1 |Specifies maximum number of highlighted snippets to generate per field. It is possible for any number of snippets from zero to this value to be generated. This parameter accepts per-field overrides.
|hl.fragsize |100 |Specifies the size, in characters, of fragments to consider for highlighting. *0* indicates that no fragmenting should be considered and the whole field value should be used. This parameter accepts per-field overrides.
|hl.requireFieldMatch |false |If set to **true**, highlights terms only if they appear in the specified field. If **false**, terms are highlighted in all requested fields regardless of which field matched the query.
|hl.maxMultiValuedToExamine |`integer.MAX_VALUE` |Specifies the maximum number of entries in a multi-valued field to examine before stopping. This can potentially return zero results if the limit is reached before any matches are found. If used with the `maxMultiValuedToMatch`, whichever limit is reached first will determine when to stop looking.
|hl.maxMultiValuedToMatch |`integer.MAX_VALUE` |Specifies the maximum number of matches in a multi-valued field that are found before stopping. If `hl.maxMultiValuedToExamine` is also defined, whichever limit is reached first will determine when to stop looking.
|hl.alternateField |blank |Specifies a field to be used as a backup default summary if Solr cannot generate a snippet (i.e., because no terms match). This parameter accepts per-field overrides.
|hl.maxAlternateFieldLength |unlimited |Specifies the maximum number of characters of the field to return. Any value less than or equal to 0 means the field's length is unlimited. This parameter is only used in conjunction with the `hl.alternateField` parameter.
|hl.highlightAlternate |true |If set to **true**, and `hl.alternateFieldName` is active, Solr will show the entire alternate field, with highlighting of occurrences. If `hl.maxAlternateFieldLength=N` is used, Solr returns max `N` characters surrounding the best matching fragment. If set to **false**, or if there is no match in the alternate field either, the alternate field will be shown without highlighting.
|hl.tag.pre +
hl.tag.post |<em> and </em> |Specifies the text that should appear before (`hl.tag.pre`) and after (`hl.tag.post`) a highlighted term. This parameter accepts per-field overrides.
|hl.phraseLimit |`integer.MAX_VALUE` |To improve the performance of the FastVectorHighlighter, you can set a limit on the number (int) of phrases to be analyzed for highlighting.
|hl.usePhraseHighlighter |true |If set to **true**, Solr will use the Lucene SpanScorer class to highlight phrase terms only when they appear within the query phrase in the document.
|hl.preserveMulti |false |If **true**, multi-valued fields will return all values in the order they were saved in the index. If **false**, the default, only values that match the highlight request will be returned.
|hl.fragListBuilder |weighted |The snippet fragmenting algorithm. The *weighted* fragListBuilder uses IDF-weights to order fragments. Other options are **single**, which returns the entire field contents as one snippet, or **simple**. You can select a fragListBuilder with this parameter, or modify an existing implementation in `solrconfig.xml` to be the default by adding "default=true".
|hl.fragmentsBuilder |default |The fragments builder is responsible for formatting the fragments, which uses <em> and </em> markup (if `hl.tag.pre` and `hl.tag.post` are not defined). Another pre-configured choice is **colored**, which is an example of how to use the fragments builder to insert HTML into the snippets for colored highlights if you choose. You can also implement your own if you'd like. You can select a fragments builder with this parameter, or modify an existing implementation in `solrconfig.xml` to be the default by adding "default=true".

== Using Boundary Scanners with the Fast Vector Highlighter

The Fast Vector Highlighter will occasionally truncate highlighted words. To prevent this, implement a boundary scanner in `solrconfig.xml`, then use the `hl.boundaryScanner` parameter to specify the boundary scanner for highlighting.

Solr supports two boundary scanners: `breakIterator` and `simple`.

[[FastVectorHighlighter-ThebreakIteratorBoundaryScanner]]
=== The `breakIterator` Boundary Scanner

The `breakIterator` boundary scanner offers excellent performance right out of the box by taking locale and boundary type into account. In most cases you will want to use the `breakIterator` boundary scanner. To implement the `breakIterator` boundary scanner, add this code to the `highlighting` section of your `solrconfig.xml` file, adjusting the type, language, and country values as appropriate to your application:

[source,xml]
----
<boundaryScanner name="breakIterator" class="solr.highlight.BreakIteratorBoundaryScanner">
  <lst name="defaults">
    <str name="hl.bs.type">WORD</str>
    <str name="hl.bs.language">en</str>
    <str name="hl.bs.country">US</str>
  </lst>
</boundaryScanner>
----

Possible values for the `hl.bs.type` parameter are WORD, LINE, SENTENCE, and CHARACTER.

[[FastVectorHighlighter-ThesimpleBoundaryScanner]]
=== The `simple` Boundary Scanner

The `simple` boundary scanner scans term boundaries for a specified maximum character value (`hl.bs.maxScan`) and for common delimiters such as punctuation marks (`hl.bs.chars`). The `simple` boundary scanner may be useful for some custom To implement the `simple` boundary scanner, add this code to the `highlighting` section of your `solrconfig.xml` file, adjusting the values as appropriate to your application:

[source,xml]
----
<boundaryScanner name="simple" class="solr.highlight.SimpleBoundaryScanner" default="true">
  <lst name="defaults">
    <str name="hl.bs.maxScan">10</str>
    <str name="hl.bs.chars">.,!?\t\n</str>
  </lst>
</boundaryScanner>
----

|===
|Class |Description
|BinaryField |Binary data.
|BoolField |Contains either true or false. Values of "1", "t", or "T" in the first character are interpreted as true. Any other values in the first character are interpreted as false.
|CollationField |Supports Unicode collation for sorting and range queries. ICUCollationField is a better choice if you can use ICU4J. See the section <<language-analysis.adoc#LanguageAnalysis-UnicodeCollation,Unicode Collation>>.
|CurrencyField |Supports currencies and exchange rates. See the section <<working-with-currencies-and-exchange-rates.adoc#working-with-currencies-and-exchange-rates,Working with Currencies and Exchange Rates>>.
|DateRangeField |Supports indexing date ranges, to include point in time date instances as well (single-millisecond durations). See the section <<working-with-dates.adoc#working-with-dates,Working with Dates>> for more detail on using this field type. Consider using this field type even if it's just for date instances, particularly when the queries typically fall on UTC year/month/day/hour, etc., boundaries.
|ExternalFileField |Pulls values from a file on disk. See the section <<working-with-external-files-and-processes.adoc#working-with-external-files-and-processes,Working with External Files and Processes>>.
|EnumField |Allows defining an enumerated set of values which may not be easily sorted by either alphabetic or numeric order (such as a list of severities, for example). This field type takes a configuration file, which lists the proper order of the field values. See the section <<working-with-enum-fields.adoc#working-with-enum-fields,Working with Enum Fields>> for more information.
|ICUCollationField |Supports Unicode collation for sorting and range queries. See the section <<language-analysis.adoc#LanguageAnalysis-UnicodeCollation,Unicode Collation>>.
|LatLonType |<<spatial-search.adoc#spatial-search,Spatial Search>>: a latitude/longitude coordinate pair. The latitude is specified first in the pair.
|PointType |<<spatial-search.adoc#spatial-search,Spatial Search>>: An arbitrary n-dimensional point, useful for searching sources such as blueprints or CAD drawings.
|PreAnalyzedField |Provides a way to send to Solr serialized token streams, optionally with independent stored values of a field, and have this information stored and indexed without any additional text processing. Configuration and usage of PreAnalyzedField is documented on the <<working-with-external-files-and-processes.adoc#WorkingwithExternalFilesandProcesses-ThePreAnalyzedFieldType,Working with External Files and Processes>> page.
|RandomSortField |Does not contain a value. Queries that sort on this field type will return results in random order. Use a dynamic field to use this feature.
|SpatialRecursivePrefixTreeFieldType |(RPT for short) <<spatial-search.adoc#spatial-search,Spatial Search>>: Accepts latitude comma longitude strings or other shapes in WKT format.
|StrField |String (UTF-8 encoded string or Unicode). Strings are intended for small fields and are _not_ tokenized or analyzed in any way. They have a hard limit of slightly less than 32K.
|TextField |Text, usually multiple words or tokens.
|TrieDateField |Date field. Represents a point in time with millisecond precision. See the section <<working-with-dates.adoc#working-with-dates,Working with Dates>>. `precisionStep="0"` enables efficient date sorting and minimizes index size; `precisionStep="8"` (the default) enables efficient range queries.
|TrieDoubleField |Double field (64-bit IEEE floating point). `precisionStep="0"` enables efficient numeric sorting and minimizes index size; `precisionStep="8"` (the default) enables efficient range queries.
|TrieField |If this field type is used, a "type" attribute must also be specified, valid values are: `integer`, `long`, `float`, `double`, `date`. Using this field is the same as using any of the Trie fields. `precisionStep="0"` enables efficient numeric sorting and minimizes index size; `precisionStep="8"` (the default) enables efficient range queries.
|TrieFloatField |Floating point field (32-bit IEEE floating point) . `precisionStep="0"` enables efficient numeric sorting and minimizes index size; `precisionStep="8"` (the default) enables efficient range queries.
|TrieIntField |Integer field (32-bit signed integer). `precisionStep="0"` enables efficient numeric sorting and minimizes index size; `precisionStep="8"` (the default) enables efficient range queries.
|TrieLongField |Long field (64-bit signed integer). `precisionStep="0"` enables efficient numeric sorting and minimizes index size; `precisionStep="8"` (the default) enables efficient range queries.
|UUIDField |Universally Unique Identifier (UUID). Pass in a value of "NEW" and Solr will create a new UUID. **Note**: configuring a UUIDField instance with a default value of "NEW" is not advisable for most users when using SolrCloud (and not possible if the UUID value is configured as the unique key field) since the result will be that each replica of each document will get a unique UUID value. Using UUIDUpdateProcessorFactory to generate UUID values when documents are added is recommended instead.

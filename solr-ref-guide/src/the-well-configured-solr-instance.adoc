This section tells you how to fine-tune your Solr instance for optimum performance. This section covers the following topics:

<<configuring-solrconfig-xml.adoc#configuring-solrconfig-xml,Configuring solrconfig.xml>>: Describes how to work with the main configuration file for Solr, `solrconfig.xml`, covering the major sections of the file.

<<solr-cores-and-solr-xml.adoc#solr-cores-and-solr-xml,Solr Cores and solr.xml>>: Describes how to work with `solr.xml` and `core.properties` to configure your Solr core, or multiple Solr cores within a single instance.

<<configuration-apis.adoc#configuration-apis,Configuration APIs>>: Describes several APIs used to configure Solr: Blob Store, Config, Request Parameters and Managed Resources.

<<implicit-requesthandlers.adoc#implicit-requesthandlers,Implicit RequestHandlers>>: Describes various end-points automatically provided by Solr and how to configure them

<<solr-plugins.adoc#solr-plugins,Solr Plugins>>: Introduces Solr plugins with pointers to more information.

<<jvm-settings.adoc#jvm-settings,JVM Settings>>: Gives some guidance on best practices for working with Java Virtual Machines.

====

The focus of this section is generally on configuring a single Solr instance, but for those interested in scaling a Solr implementation in a cluster environment, see also the section <<solrcloud.adoc#solrcloud,SolrCloud>>. There are also options to scale through sharding or replication, described in the section <<legacy-scaling-and-distribution.adoc#legacy-scaling-and-distribution,Legacy Scaling and Distribution>>.

= Blob Store API
:page-shortname: blob-store-api
:page-permalink: blob-store-api.html

The Blob Store REST API provides REST methods to store, retrieve or list files in a Lucene index. This can be used to upload a jar file which contains standard solr components such as RequestHandlers, SearchComponents, or other custom code you have written for Solr. Schema components _do not_ yet support the Blob Store.

When using the blob store, note that the API does not delete or overwrite a previous object if a new one is uploaded with the same name. It always adds a new version of the blob to the index. Deletes can be performed with standard REST delete commands.

*The blob store is only available when running in SolrCloud mode.* Solr in standalone mode does not support use of a blob store.

The blob store API is implemented as a requestHandler. A special collection named ".system" must be created as the collection that contains the blob store index.

[[BlobStoreAPI-Createa.systemCollection]]
=== Create a .system Collection

Before using the blob store, a special collection must be created and it must be named `.system`.

The BlobHandler is automatically registered in the .system collection. The `solrconfig.xml`, Schema, and other configuration files for the collection are automatically provided by the system and don't need to be defined specifically.

If you do not use the `-shards` or `-replicationFactor` options, then defaults of 1 shard and 1 replica will be used.

You can create the `.system` collection with the <<collections-api.adoc#collections-api,Collections API>>, as in this example:

[source,bash]
----
curl "http://localhost:8983/solr/admin/collections?action=CREATE&name=.system&replicationFactor=2"
----

 Note that the `bin/solr` script cannot be used to create the `.system ` collection at this time. Also, please ensure that there is at least one collection created before creating the `.system` collection.

[[BlobStoreAPI-UploadFilestoBlobStore]]
=== Upload Files to Blob Store

After the `.system` collection has been created, files can be uploaded to the blob store with a request similar to the following:

[source,bash]
----
curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/octet-stream' --data-binary @{filename} http://localhost:8983/solr/.system/blob/{blobname}
----

For example, to upload a file named "test1.jar" as a blob named "test", you would make a POST request like:

[source,bash]
----
curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/octet-stream' --data-binary @test1.jar http://localhost:8983/solr/.system/blob/test
----

A GET request will return the list of blobs and other details:

[source,bash]
----
curl http://localhost:8983/solr/.system/blob?omitHeader=true
----

Output:

[source,json]
----
{
  "response":{"numFound":1,"start":0,"docs":[
      {
        "id":"test/1",
        "md5":"20ff915fa3f5a5d66216081ae705c41b",
        "blobName":"test",
        "version":1,
        "timestamp":"2015-02-04T16:45:48.374Z",
        "size":13108}]
  }
}
----

Details on individual blobs can be accessed with a request similar to:

[source,bash]
----
curl http://localhost:8983/solr/.system/blob/{blobname}
----

For example, this request will return only the blob named 'test':

[source,bash]
----
curl http://localhost:8983/solr/.system/blob/test?omitHeader=true
----

Output:

[source,json]
----
{
  "response":{"numFound":1,"start":0,"docs":[
      {
        "id":"test/1",
        "md5":"20ff915fa3f5a5d66216081ae705c41b",
        "blobName":"test",
        "version":1,
        "timestamp":"2015-02-04T16:45:48.374Z",
        "size":13108}]
  }
}
----

The filestream response writer can return a particular version of a blob for download, as in:

[source,bash]
----
curl http://localhost:8983/solr/.system/blob/{blobname}/{version}?wt=filestream > {outputfilename}
----

For the latest version of a blob, the \{version} can be omitted,

[source,bash]
----
curl http://localhost:8983/solr/.system/blob/{blobname}?wt=filestream > {outputfilename}
----

[[BlobStoreAPI-UseaBlobinaHandlerorComponent]]
=== Use a Blob in a Handler or Component

To use the blob as the class for a request handler or search component, you create a request handler in `solrconfig.xml` as usual. You will need to define the following parameters:

* `class`: the fully qualified class name. For example, if you created a new request handler class called CRUDHandler, you would enter `org.apache.solr.core.CRUDHandler`.
* `runtimeLib`: Set to true to require that this component should be loaded from the classloader that loads the runtime jars.

For example, to use a blob named test, you would configure `solrconfig.xml` like this:

[source,xml]
----
<requestHandler name="/myhandler" class="org.apache.solr.core.myHandler" runtimeLib="true" version="1">
</requestHandler>
----

If there are parameters available in the custom handler, you can define them in the same way as any other request handler definition.

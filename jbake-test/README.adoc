This directory is a sample project using http://www.jbake.org/[JBake] as a static site generator for the Solr Ref Guide.

If you have JBake installed locally (see http://www.jbake.org/docs/2.4.0/#installation), you can launch the JBake server to see the existing content in this project.

. Change directory to the top-level `jbake-test` directory.
. Issue command `jbake -s`. This will start the JBake server in the foreground; if you close your terminal window the server will die.
.. If you want to generate the HTML pages, you can use `jbake -b` to "bake" the pages.
.. You can combine generating the HTML and starting the server with `jbake -b -s`.
. Then go to http://localhost:8820/RefGuide/book.html for the Solr Ref Guide content.

JBake sample content is at http://localhost:8820 but work has not been completed to replace the sample content with Ref Guide, nor provide a link to it. The only way to see the content is to go to it with the URL above.

Also, while JBake provides several options for modifying templates, these have not yet been customized.

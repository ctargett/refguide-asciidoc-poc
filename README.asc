= Solr Ref Guide in Asciidoc
:toc:

toc::[]

This project is a proof of concept to evaluate changing the Apache Solr Ref Guide from being managed as a Confluence wiki to text files committed as part of Solr source code. HTML pages and PDFs could be generated using a publishing toolchain that is integrated with existing Solr/Lucene build processes.

This README describes the reasons for the change, what this POC demonstrates, and a short introduction on how to work with the recommended markdown format.

== Why Change?

* Confluence is a wiki, and is primarily focused on team collaboration. In earlier releases, simplicity of content authoring was a focus (i.e., when it supported wiki markup language), but collaboration features are increasingly taking precedence over ease of use. These are not necessarily bad for Solr, but the editing experience has suffered.

* The presentation of the content is problematic and complex. While it’s simple to override the default stylesheets, the divs and classes are not clearly identified and change at random with updates.

* The presentation of text cannot be separated from the writing of the content. While editing a page, users must think about how the tables will lay out, how code boxes will appear, etc. Each of these items are barriers for non-Confluence experts to contribute to the documentation.

* Documentation is divorced from the code, creating another barrier for keeping documentation up-to-date when code changes occur. An alternative option could be to include the documentation with the source code repository; patches could include documentation updates with the code changes.

* Versioning the online version of the guide is problematic. The only way Confluence supports versioning is to create copies of each "space" for each release. This adds to the maintenance burden for producing the Ref Guide, which is already taxed around the time of each release. We could instead use the existing versioning system currently used for Lucene and Solr Javadocs. If the publication process is integrated with the build process, instead of developing a new process, we could use the existing process.


== Why Asciidoc and Asciidoctor

Asciidoc is a lightweight text markup format which is similar to Markdown, but which has a broader range of markup notations for article and book publishing purposes.

The original asciidoc format has been extended and enhanced by a text processor and publishing toolchain called Asciidoctor.

So why do we struggle to write documents?

The main reason we struggle is because we don’t write documents the same way we write e-mail. Instead, we allow ourselves to get distracted by complex word processors, bury the content in XML schemas like DocBook, or battle with finicky WYSIWYG editors. How did we get ourselves into this mess?

== Proof of Concept Ref Guide
This section describes the process for converting the Ref Guide and open issues for discussion.

=== What's in this Repo?
This repo is a proof-of-concept for converting the Ref Guide to Asciidoc format. It includes:

* The currrent ref guide exported to HTML format (on 31 August 2015), and converted to Asciidoc format, in the `confluence-export` directory.
* Scripts to support converting from Confluence to Asciidoc format (more below).
* A few sample pages from the conversion with some additional cleanup, in the `asciidoc` directory.
* A sample `build.xml` to generate HTML and PDF versions of the sample pages.
* Scripts to assist with PDF generation.
* Sample HTML and PDF files with preliminary design included.

=== Content Conversion Process
Confluence content has been converted with the following process:

* Export in HTML from Confluence
* Lucidworks conversion ant tasks found in `confluence-export/conversion-tools/jsoup/build.xml`:
** Clean up confluence styles (`ant scrape`)
** Add document hierarchy as links to each page (`ant map` then `ant hier`)
* Pandocs for html -> asciidoc conversion

Once the pages have been converted, they need some additional cleanup:

* Pandocs uses asciidoc conventions, some of which are simplified and extended with asciidoctor. For consistency, these should be modified:
** Headings in asciidoc use `~` and `^` symbols to indicate levels, while Asciidoctor uses multiple equal signs `=` to indicate the level (the number of equal signs is the heading level). The equal sign approach is more straightforward and readable when editing pages.
** Code example boxes are defined in asciidoc by multiple hyphens in a row before and after the example, Asciidoctor uses 4 hyphens.
** <more to come>
* Images exported out of Confluence have arcane naming and an odd directory structure. We should make the effort to clean those up in a consolidated image directory with human-readable names.

It's important to note that conversion of content may be a time- and labor-intensive process, but is only required once.

=== Organization

How should we organize the Ref Guide pages in the directory tree?

* As chapters, with a folder for each main subject heading.
* As one big directory of files.

=== Build Process

Asciidoctor is a toolchain written in Ruby which facilitates converting text files to other formats for publishing. One sub-project is the `asciidoctor-ant` plugin for Apache Ant.

==== HTML

Uses `asciidoctor-ant` plugin to convert to HTML. To generate HTML, simply run `ant html`.

This task sets the output format, defines a custom stylesheet (see Styles, below), and defines the plugin to use for code syntax highlighting, and other parameters.

===== HTML-related Rules in build.xml

The first part gets the required JAR file.

[source,xml]
----
<get src="http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-ant/1.5.1/asciidoctor-ant-1.5.1.jar"
  dest="lib/asciidoctor-ant.jar" usetimestamp="true"/>
----

The second part defines the rules for converting the documents to HTML.

[source,xml]
----
<target name="doc">
  <taskdef uri="antlib:org.asciidoctor.ant" resource="org/asciidoctor/ant/antlib.xml" classpath="lib/asciidoctor-ant.jar"/>
  <asciidoctor:convert
               sourceDirectory="asciidoc"
               outputDirectory="html"
               backend="html5"
               extensions="asc"
               sourceHighlighter="coderay"
               embedAssets="true"
               imagesDir="asciidoc/images">
    <attribute key="docinfo1" value='' />
    <attribute key="stylesheet" value="ref-guide.css" />
    <attribute key="stylesdir" value="html/styles" />
    <attribute key="icons" value="font" />
    <attribute key="figure-caption!" value='' />
    <attribute key="toc" value="right" />
 </asciidoctor:convert>
</target>
----

Still To Do:

* Remove Lucidworks branding from header/footer called with `docinfo1` attribute & add Solr/Lucene/ASF branding.
* Figure out why `docinfo1` attribute isn't working to add header/footer to pages automatically.
* Determine where to put the pages online. See also section on <<Publishing Options>>.

==== PDF

===== Current Behavior

Currently the `ant pdf` target calls a script `pdf/scripts/createPDF.sh` which relies on the `asciidoctor-pdf` gem to be installed on the local machine.

To install this gem locally, follow these steps:

. `gem install --pre asciidoctor-pdf`
. `gem install coderay`

The second step installs the plugin that provides code syntax highlighting (Pygments is better IMO, but is not supported by `asciidoctor-ant` at this time.)

See https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-pdf for more details on using this plugin.

=== Publication Bugs

There are some known issues that may impact our ability to convert documents as we want:

* Possibly an issue with pipe characters inside literal blocks in tables: https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor/issues/1421. Unclear if we have any of these.

===== Issues
It seems `asciidoctor-ant` should be able to handle the PDF conversion, but it doesn't.

Another plugin `asciidoctor-pdf` allows conversion direct to PDF, although this is a gem? It also has other dependencies, I think. Can it be a jar, like `asciidoctor-ant`?

=== Styling

==== HTML
The `ant html` task applies a custom stylesheet found in `html/styles/ref-guide.css`. This is an adaptation of the default Asciidoc stylesheet.

Some items still to do:

* Update styles for Solr branding.

==== PDF

PDF styles are driven by themes, which are defined in YAML files. The current theme is found in `pdf/themes/refguide-theme.yml`. The command to generate the PDF must include the theme directory and theme name or it will fall back to the default theme.

The default theme has been modified to update the font colors. Some items still to do:

* Proper headers and footers
* Title page with appropriate ASF branding
* Light gray highlight on inline monospace

Instructions on how to modify the theme are found in the https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-pdf/blob/master/docs/theming-guide.adoc[Asciidoctor PDF Theming Guide].

=== Publishing Options

Host in ASF CMS with website.

Host however the javadocs are hosted.
